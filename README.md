# Combining-RGB-image-channels-to-get-Color-Image
This is a basic project intended for beginners in Computer Vision field.


The tool used here is Matlab.


An image is given where the representation is such that the Blue channel is given in the first layer, then comes the Green and Red channels accordingly.

The row pixels are divided by 3 to obtain the respective color channels. Then the RGB channels are combined together to form a single color image.
